SMS Spam Prediction 

## Introduction
Today, internet and social media have become the fastest and easiest ways to get information. In this age, reviews, opinions, feedbacks, messages and recommendations have become significant source of information. Thanks to advancement in technologies, we are now able to extract meaningful information from such data using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. NLP , a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), makes use of computers and human natural language to output valuable information. NLP is commonly used in text classification task such as spam detection and sentiment analysis, text generation, language translations and document classification.

## Purpose
Build SMS Spam Classification Model using Naive Bayes and Random forest.

## Data set
The SMS (text) data was downloaded from UCI datasets. It contains 5,574 SMS phone messages. The data were collected for the purpose of mobile phone spam research and have already been labeled as either spam or ham.<br />

## Data Cleaning 
 * Dropping special Characters
 * Dropping Stopwords
 * Stemming or Lemmatization
 * Word Embedding - Vectorization
   * Bag of words
   * TF-IDF

## Using Naive Bayes
## Using Pipeline and making a prediction
## Evaluate our model by using our predictions, we will be able to see precision, recall, f1 score and support. The classification reports.
